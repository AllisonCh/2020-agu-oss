## Description

Modern science increasingly relies on code, ranging from small scripts to workflows with
many interacting parts. Reproducibility and extension of studies employing these codes
require that they are accessible. The open-source community has established modern
best-practices for making software available, usable, and maintainable. In this
workshop, we will demonstrate a workflow for publishing research code following these
best-practices. We will cover open-source licenses, version control, automated testing,
documentation, and continuous integration. The workshop will be hands-on: participants
will work to set up a project using sample code provided by the instructors. By the end,
participants will have the knowledge needed to continue learning independently and apply
these practices to their own research code. These resources can be applied to any
programming language or scientific discipline.


## Learning Objectives

Our aim with this workshop is for participants to:

1. Gain awareness of tools available to researchers within the open-source ecosystem
   including Jupyter, git, ReadTheDocs, continuous integration services (for testing), etc
2. Learn modern best-practices for structuring a repository for research software that
   promotes accessibility, reusability, and reproducibility
3. Learn about the tools available for testing, publishing documentation, and versioning
   that can be immediately applied to their own codes
